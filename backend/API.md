# CrowdPay Backend API

This file is the reference for every HTTP route the backend serves. The
[route table](#route-table) must match the routers mounted in
`src/index.js` exactly: `src/routes/apiDocs.test.js` fails when a route is added,
removed or renamed without updating this table (and when a `###` heading below
names a route that does not exist).

## Interactive Swagger UI

In development, browse the interactive API docs at `GET /api/docs`.

## Conventions

- **Base path**: every JSON route lives under `/api`, except `GET /health` and `GET /health/ledger`.
- **Authentication**: `POST /api/auth/login` and `POST /api/auth/register` set an httpOnly `cp_token`
  cookie (plus a `cp_refresh_token` cookie used by `POST /api/auth/refresh`). Browser clients send the
  cookie with `credentials: "include"`. Server-to-server clients may instead send
  `Authorization: Bearer <token>`, where the token is either the access token or a `cp_live_…` API key
  from `POST /api/api-keys`.
- **Errors**: non-2xx responses have the shape `{ "error": "message" }`, and some include a
  machine-readable `code`.

Auth column in the table:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Public | No credentials required |
| Optional | Works anonymously; more fields for the owner/admin |
| User | Any authenticated user (additional ownership checks noted per route) |
| Owner | Authenticated campaign owner (or member role noted) |
| Admin | `role=admin` |
| Super admin | `is_super_admin=true` |
| Platform | The configured `PLATFORM_APPROVER_USER_ID` (any user in dev when unset) |
| Signed | Provider HMAC signature, no user session |

## Contribution conversion model

- Campaigns define a default settlement asset via `campaigns.asset_type` (`USDC` or `XLM`).
- Contributors can pay using `send_asset`.
- If `send_asset !== campaign.asset_type`, the backend uses Stellar `pathPaymentStrictReceive` so the campaign receives the exact requested `amount` in its settlement asset.
- Conversion path discovery uses Stellar Horizon `strictReceivePaths` and applies a `5%` slippage buffer when computing `sendMax`.
- Additional credit assets can be enabled through `STELLAR_EXTRA_ASSETS` in `.env` as a JSON object (`{"CODE":"ISSUER"}`).


## Route table

Deprecated aliases still respond but will be removed; new integrations must use the canonical route.

- `POST /api/users/register` and `POST /api/users/login` (and every other `/api/users/*` copy of the auth
  router) were undocumented duplicates of `/api/auth/*`. No client used them, so they have been removed. Use `/api/auth/*`.

## Endpoint details

### `GET /api/users/me`

Authenticated. Returns the current profile: `id`, `email`, `name`, `wallet_public_key`, `wallet_type`, `role`,
`kyc_status` (`unverified`, `pending`, `verified`, `rejected`), `kyc_completed_at`, `created_at`, and
`kyc_required_for_campaigns` (boolean, from `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS`).

### `POST /api/auth/verify-email`

Public. Validates a verification token and marks the associated user's email as verified.

Body:
- `token` (required): the token from the verification email link.

Returns `200` on success (including when the email was already verified), or `400` if the token is missing, invalid or expired (> 24 hours).

### `POST /api/auth/resend-verification`

Authenticated. Generates a new verification token and sends a new email.
Rate-limited to 3 requests per hour per user.

### `POST /api/users/me/kyc/start`

Authenticated. Creates a hosted KYC session with the configured provider and marks the user `pending`.

Response includes `redirect_url` or `session_token`, plus the updated user. Persona is used when `KYC_PROVIDER=persona`, `PERSONA_API_KEY`, and `PERSONA_TEMPLATE_ID` are configured; otherwise local development returns a dev redirect URL.

### `POST /api/webhooks/kyc`

KYC provider callback. Updates the matched user to `verified` or `rejected` from provider status. The campaign creation gate is controlled by `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS` and defaults to enabled; set it to `false` for testnet/dev.

### `POST /api/campaigns`

Authenticated creator/admin endpoint. The user must have `email_verified=true`. Additionally, when `KYC_REQUIRED_FOR_CAMPAIGNS` is not `false`, the user must have `kyc_status=verified`; otherwise the API returns `403` with `code=KYC_REQUIRED` or `code=EMAIL_NOT_VERIFIED`.

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `amount` (required): amount the campaign should ultimately receive
- `anchor_id` (required): anchor identifier from `/api/anchor/info`

Success response includes:

- anchor session `id`

- `anchor_transaction_id`
- `anchor_asset` / `anchor_amount`
- `conversion_quote` when the eventual contribution needs a path payment

### `GET /api/anchor/deposits/:id`

Authenticated. Polls the anchor transaction, updates the local anchor session, and once the deposit completes automatically submits the normal Stellar contribution from the user’s custodial wallet.

### Anchor environment configuration

Anchor deposit support requires a configured backend anchor signing wallet and an enabled anchor.
Set `ANCHOR_WALLET_HOME_DOMAIN` and `ANCHOR_WALLET_SIGNING_SECRET` in the backend environment.
MoneyGram anchor support is enabled by default unless `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENABLED=false`.
Use `ANCHOR_MONEYGRAM_ENV=sandbox|preview|production` to select the MoneyGram deployment.

For a custom anchor, configure `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ID`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_NAME`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_HOME_DOMAIN`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_WEB_AUTH_ENDPOINT`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SEP24_ENDPOINT`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_SIGNING_KEY`, `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_CODE`, and `ANCHOR_CUSTOM_ASSET_ISSUER`.

### `GET /api/contributions/campaign/:campaignId`

    "created_at": "2026-04-23T08:13:34.392Z"
  }
]
```

### `GET /api/withdrawals/capabilities`

Returns whether the authenticated user may perform **platform** signing/rejection (`can_approve_platform`). If `PLATFORM_APPROVER_USER_ID` is set in the backend environment, only that user’s JWT subject matches; otherwise (dev only) any authenticated user may act as platform for API calls.

### `POST /api/withdrawals/request`

Create a pending withdrawal request (creator only). Verifies multisig on the campaign wallet, ensures the campaign is `active` or `funded`, and rejects if another `pending` withdrawal already exists for the same campaign.

Body:

- `campaign_id` (required)
- `destination_key` (required)
- `amount` (required)

Returns `201` with withdrawal request (`creator_signed=false`, `platform_signed=false`, `status=pending`).

Appends an audit row to `withdrawal_approval_events` with action `requested`.

Errors:

- `403` caller is not campaign creator
- `409` request no longer pending, campaign status not `active`/`funded`, or already creator-approved

Logs `creator_signed` in `withdrawal_approval_events`.

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/approve/platform`

Platform approval/finalization step. `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/approve` is a deprecated alias. Signs with platform key, validates dual-signature presence, and submits to Stellar.

Errors:

- `403` caller cannot perform platform signature (see `PLATFORM_APPROVER_USER_ID`)
- `409` creator approval missing, campaign status not eligible, or request not pending
- `422` insufficient signatures in XDR
- `502` Stellar rejected the transaction — request is marked `failed` and `submit_failed` is logged

Success:

- marks request as `status=submitted`
- stores Stellar `tx_hash`
- logs `platform_signed` in `withdrawal_approval_events`

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/cancel`

### `POST /api/withdrawals/:id/reject`

Platform-only (same rules as platform approve). Rejects a **pending** request **after** creator has signed and **before** platform signature. Sets `status=denied`. Body optional: `{ "reason": "..." }`. Logs `platform_rejected`.

### `GET /api/withdrawals/campaign/:campaignId`

List withdrawal requests for a campaign (`denial_reason` included when denied). **Authorized for campaign creator or configured platform approver only** (others receive `403`).

### `GET /api/withdrawals/:id/events`

`GET /api/withdrawals/:id/audit` is a deprecated alias. Immutable audit timeline for one withdrawal: `action`, `actor_user_id`, `note`, `metadata`, `created_at`. Same authorization as the campaign list endpoint.

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/embed`

Public, CORS-enabled campaign payload for iframe embeds. The campaign ID is a UUID and must be passed unchanged. Returns campaign title, description, amounts, asset, status, progress percentage, contributor count, and a contribution URL.

The embeddable widget polls this endpoint every 30 seconds. Use `GET /api/campaigns/:id/stream` for live SSE updates.

### `GET /api/campaigns/:id/analytics`

Contribution analytics for the last 30 days, **restricted to the campaign owner or an admin** (others receive `403`). Returns `dailyTotals`, `assetBreakdown`, and `topContributors`. Deleted or unknown campaigns return `404`.

### `GET /api/milestones/campaign/:campaignId`

List milestones for a campaign in display order.

Success response (`200`):

```json

- `destination_key` (required): Stellar public key that will receive the approved release

Errors:

- `403` caller is not the campaign creator
- `409` campaign is not yet in a releaseable state, or milestone is already released
- `400` destination key is invalid

### `POST /api/milestones/:id/release`

Platform-only. `POST /api/milestones/:id/approve` is a deprecated alias. Reviews the submitted milestone, signs the escrow withdrawal using the existing dual-signature flow, submits it to Stellar, records the withdrawal, and advances campaign status to `in_progress` or `completed`.

Body:

- `reason` (optional): review note stored with the milestone and audit trail

Errors:

- `403` caller cannot perform platform approval

## Auditability and traceability

- Every indexed contribution stores:
  - `payment_type` (`payment` vs `path_payment_strict_receive`)
  - destination settlement `amount` and `asset`
  - conversion source `source_amount` and `source_asset` (when applicable)
  - `conversion_rate` (`destination_amount / source_amount`)
  - conversion `path` as JSON
  - immutable Stellar `tx_hash`
- This enables independent reconciliation against Horizon payment records by `tx_hash`.

- Manual fund releases append rows to `withdrawal_approval_events` (`requested`, `creator_signed`, `platform_signed`, `creator_cancelled`, `platform_rejected`, `submit_failed`) with optional `note` and `metadata` JSON for audit and manual review.

- Milestone-based releases reuse the same multisig withdrawal machinery, but the release is triggered from platform approval after the creator has submitted evidence and a payout destination.

- Anchor-assisted contributions persist `anchor_id` and `anchor_transaction_id` on the final `contributions` row for support and reconciliation.

## Ledger monitor health

### `GET /health/ledger`

Public JSON snapshot for operations: Horizon **cursor** row per active campaign wallet (from `ledger_stream_cursors`), in-process **SSE stream state** (`connected`, `reconnecting`, `error`, `not_connected`), last message time, reconnect attempt count, and `stale_stream_no_messages_15m` when a supposedly connected stream has had no SSE traffic for 15 minutes.

The backend also logs a **warning** every 5 minutes if any wallet is in that stale state.

## Test coverage

Route behaviour is covered by the `src/routes/*.test.js` suites (`npm test`). `src/routes/apiDocs.test.js`
checks that the route table above matches the mounted routers.
