# Operations: automatic Stellar trustlines and custodial funding

CrowdPay hides trustline and reserve mechanics from contributors. The backend ensures custodial accounts can hold every **configured credit asset** (for example USDC and any entries in `STELLAR_EXTRA_ASSETS`) before money moves on-chain.

## When trustlines and funding run

1. **User registration (`POST /api/auth/register`)**  
   After the user row is stored, the API schedules **asynchronous** provisioning (same process, `setImmediate`):  
   - The generated custodial Stellar seed is envelope-encrypted before it is written to `users.wallet_secret_encrypted`.  
   - If the Stellar account does not exist yet, the **platform** submits `createAccount` with enough XLM for reserves plus all trustlines.  
   - The custodial **user master key** signs a `changeTrust` transaction for each missing configured credit asset.  
   Registration **always** returns `201` with a token even if Horizon is temporarily unavailable; failures are logged as `[users] Background Stellar funding/trustlines failed`.

2. **Contribution (`POST /api/contributions`)**  
   Before building or submitting a payment, the route **awaits** `ensureCustodialAccountFundedAndTrusted`. That repeats the same checks so a user who registered during an outage or before new assets were added still succeeds without manual trustline work. If setup fails, the API responds **`503`** with:  
   `Wallet setup is still completing; please retry in a few seconds.`

3. **Campaign wallet creation (`createCampaignWallet` in `stellarService`)**  
   The funded campaign account receives **`changeTrust`** for **every** configured credit asset in one setup transaction (before multisig locks the account). Starting XLM on `createAccount` is sized from the number of those assets.

## Code entry points (for on-call / debugging)

| Routine | File | Role |
|--------|------|------|
| `ensureCustodialAccountFundedAndTrusted` | `src/services/stellarService.js` | Single entry used by contributions; runs funding then trustlines. |
| `fundCustodialAccountFromPlatformIfNeeded` | same | `createAccount` from `PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY` when the pubkey is not on the ledger. |
| `submitMissingTrustlinesForCustodialAccount` | same | Idempotent `changeTrust` batch for missing lines only. |
| `listCreditAssetCodes` | same | All supported codes except `XLM`. |
| Background hook | `src/routes/auth.js` | `setImmediate` after successful register. |

## Configuration

- **`USDC_ISSUER`** — required for USDC trustlines (same as today).  
- **`STELLAR_EXTRA_ASSETS`** — optional JSON map of additional `CODE → issuer`; each becomes a required trustline on new custodial and campaign accounts.  
- **`PLATFORM_SECRET_KEY`** — must hold enough XLM on the active network to pay `createAccount` and fees for expected signup volume.

## Monitoring

- Search logs for `[users] Background Stellar` and `[contributions] Custodial account setup failed`.  
- Spikes in contribution **503** responses with the wallet-setup message usually mean Horizon issues or an under-funded platform account.

## What end users do

Nothing. The product does not expose trustline or reserve steps in onboarding or contribution flows.
